<h2>About me</h2>
<section>
<p> My name is Patrick Guanzing and I am a Computer Science major at Cerritos College. It
is my second year at Cerritos and I am taking this class because I have been very lackluster in html
knowledge. I believe that by taking this class it will help me improve my understanding of HTML and will also benefit me
in the future of my career. Some personal hobbies that I enjoy are spending time with friends, the automotive scene, the
programming scene, and also personal fitness. One cool thing that happened to me recently was reaching a new 
bench press PR of 300 pounds! I was super proud of that accomplishment.
