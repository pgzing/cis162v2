   <section id="leftColumn">
      <p>One of the things I have been trying to work on constantly is personal fitness,
	  and during this past year I was able to focus on working on myselfwhichled to my love for the gym.
	  To me the gym is a place to train yourself physically, but many people do not understand the mental training you undergo
	  by going to the gym. You learn to build discipline while also learning to create a plan to follow through.
	  It has changed my life for the better and I cannt wait to see where it can lead me in the future.</p>
